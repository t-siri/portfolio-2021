{% contentfor introduction %}
I had the opportunity to brand, design and implement Innovo's marketing website.

Innovo is a company that provides multiple work such as construction, welding and many more. 

My client wanted to go online and allow his clients to understand his business and services.
{% endcontentfor %}


{% contentfor problem %}
Our client wanted a marketing website that represented their company online.

They also wanted to make sure that their website's SEO is implemented to a standard so that Google could identify their business.

It was important that the website shows the company's services but also projects provided in a *blog*. 
{% endcontentfor %}


{% contentfor solution %}
I spent some time understanding my client's business and what his everyday process is like. 

I then started to research on marketing websites in the industry to see what his competitors were doing.

I then prototyped the website and also designed the branding system, from there I started implementing my designs.
{% endcontentfor %}


{% contentfor outcome %}
The site is not yet public as some content review needs to be done.

But the branding, prototype and implementation is completed within a week. 

Since my client also wanted the ability to blog his projects easily, I also designed and provided the solution on the website.
