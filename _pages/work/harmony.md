{% contentfor introduction %}
Self taught is an online app that helps students learn languages and log their progress with their studies.

If assigned, teachers can view their student's progress and review their homework.

Students also have the capability of reviewing on their own by adding new words to the dictionary and the audio book.

{% contentfor problem %}
My client requested to redesign the application that he developed, he wanted it to be mobile responsive and more user friendly.

He also requested a more modern design and a better user flow in the app.

Since my client wanted to focus on the students in this application, I had decided to redesign the application as a student user and focus on the experience of the application as a student.
{% endcontentfor %}


{% contentfor solution %}
I have decided to design the mobile experience of the application first and made sure to design the web after.

I interviewed the students and their process into learning a new language and how they would have used the application, I found their pain points and made sure I tend to them.

The application was then redesigned with a new UI and UX.
{% endcontentfor %}


{% contentfor outcome %}
The client was happy with the designs produced. 

Given the application was already built, it was not too hard to re-design and brand the application. 

The focus on the user journey and better user interface allowed me to produce the designs rapidly.
