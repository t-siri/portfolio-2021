{% contentfor introduction %}
<a href="/advance-cabello" target="_blank">Advance Cabello</a> is a company in Thailad that distributes high quality hair products nation-wide.

Since Thailand has a different experience with online ordering, the company had to cater to their clients. 
{% endcontentfor %}


{% contentfor problem %}
My client wanted a website to not only represent their company, but displays the products they produce and allow users to understand the company's goals.

It was specifically important to show products available as my client could quickly jump onto the website and show their customers products they sell.

It was important that the website was mobile friendly and also translated to Thai promptly as not all Advance Cabello's clients read English.
{% endcontentfor %}


{% contentfor solution %}
After some research on how sales are done in Thailand as well as inspiration research, I came up with the design.

I wanted the lines to represent hairs, and during the time I was designing and developing the site, I was experimenting with **SVG animations** and wanted to further explore that.

Although, today many people may argue that a splash page is an extra and unwanted page. I felt that it was important to show the SVG animations and also the *feel* of the company with the elegance and animations provided - which, the other pages would cover up given the content.

{% contentfor outcome %}
I wrote the website in HTML and styled in SCSS. I made sure that the website was mobile friendly as well because my client's sales team often travels around Thailand to sell products.

By using JavaScript, I was able to make the website translate to Thai promptly and immediately - as some customers cannot read English.
