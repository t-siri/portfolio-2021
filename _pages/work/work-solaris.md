{% contentfor introduction %}
During my employment with <a href="/workingmouse" target="_blank">WorkingMouse</a> I had the opportunity to work with <a href="/codebotsmarketing">Codebots</a> and developed a design system that was available online for individuals who need to refer the company's design and branding rules.

I had the opportunity to design <a href="/codebotssolaris">Codebots Solaris Design System</a> and develop it. My lead, Isaac Joekong alongside my coworker Raouf Al-Araji, and I worked on the components design.

The idea behind Solaris were to have a source of truth in Codebots design and content creativity. To make sure that products are harmonised and in sync.

{% contentfor problem %}
As the company grew with more employers onboard in the company, it was crucial to have a source of truth on design and component rules. The company created Solaris to keep all products under Codebots in harmony. 

The goal behind this was that when everyone, especially developers, came to a website they view rules of design but also components. These components were documented by design, usage and code usage. 

The website had to be clear and easy to navigate to the right content.

{% contentfor solution %}
I designed the Solaris Design System site and broke it up into sections. It was important that in the components section, that content was broken into three sections, the overview, the usage and the code.

The overview represented the components' look and states *(hover, active, focus for example)*, the usage explained when to use and when not to use the component, and lastly the code was for the developers to document on how to use the component on the platform.

It was important that these components were well document so that new developers who would be onboarded could understand how to re-use them.

{% contentfor outcome %}
Solaris had constantly been improved and added to. The organisation of content allows employers in the company quickly find a source of truth. 

Development time would be saved by re-using these components. This created a better workflow as well as a faster and organised way of development and design.
