{% contentfor introduction %}
During my employment with <a href="/workingmouse" target="_blank">WorkingMouse</a> I had the opportunity to work with <a href="/codebotsmarketing">Codebots</a> and developed a design system that is available online for individuals who need to reference the company's design and branding rules.

I had the opportunity to design <a href="/codebotssolaris">Codebots Solaris Design System</a> and develop it. My lead Isaac Joekong alongside my coworker Raouf Al-Araji and I worked on the components design.

The idea behind Solaris is to have a source of truth in Codebots design and content creativity. To make sure that products are harmonised and in sync.

{% contentfor problem %}
As the company grew and more employers onboard in the company, it was crucial to have a source of truth on design and component rules. The company created Solaris to keep all products under Codebots in harmony. 

The goal behind this is for everyone, especially developers to come to a website and view rules of design but also components. These components are documented by design, usage and code usage. 

The website had to be clear, and easy to navigate to the right content.

{% contentfor solution %}
I designed the Solaris Design System site and broke it up into sections. It was important that in the components section, that content is broken up into three sections, the overview, the usage and the code.

The overview represents the components' look and states *(hover, active, focus for example)*, the usage explains when to use the component and when not to use the component, and lastly the code is for the developers to document on how to use the component on the platform.

It is important that these components are well document so that new developers who are onboarded can understand how to re-use them.

{% contentfor outcome %}
Solaris is constantly being improved and added to. The organisation of content allows employers in the company quickly find a source of truth and also save time. 

Development time will be saved by re-using these components. This creates a better workflow as well as a faster and organised way of development and design.
