{% contentfor introduction %}
During my employment with <a href="/workingmouse" target="_blank">WorkingMouse</a> I had the opportunity to work with <a href="/codebotsmarketing">Codebots</a> and developed both <a href="/work-codebots-v1">version 1</a> and version 2 of the marketing website.

After deploying the MVP of version 1, the company had the opportunity to do some user testing and user research to further improve the marketing site in order to get more traction. 

My lead Isaac Joekong conducted user testing on version 1 of the marketing website and made design updates accordingly.

{% contentfor problem %}
As the company deployed the MVP of version 1, user testing was conducted and the design lead of Codebots received new learnings.

With these learnings, it was discovered that there are a lot of design updates that can be done in order to gain the users' attention on the site. 

These new design updates required re-coding and also new coding in the front-end. It was crucial that these are components that allow re-use for future purposes.

{% contentfor solution %}
It was recognised that the website had a lot of content and had to be broken up into a few more sections. There were also some more *modern* designs that could be introduced such as a carousel component and tabs to view information. 

Components were re-iterated and written in a way to allow re-use. I also had the opportunity to update and clean a few sections in order to hand-over to the next developer. 

With the new designs, I was able to work more on animations and also learnt new things along the way such as jekyll loops, svg animations and the carousel component.

{% contentfor outcome %}
The marketing website is now stable and has minor improvements to it. 

Given the time to code version 2, there are more interactive components on the site. Alongside that, there are animations added for site polishing, which is crucial.

I made sure before the handover of the code that it was well documented and put into section accordingly. Now the site is managed by Jordi Kitto.
