{% contentfor introduction %}
During my employment with <a href="https://workingmouse.com.au/" target="_blank">WorkingMouse</a> I had the opportunity to work with Kindred a client in realestate.

The client wanted to change the realestate workflow and to do so, it required a client portal.

Alongside this client portal we also created the <a href="/work-kindred-admin">Green Zone Portal</a>, which allows Kindred to communicate with clients promptly.

{% contentfor problem %}
Kindred wanted an innovative way for clients to contact them whenever they see fit to their own schedule and recieve a response right away.

Our client saw a flaw in realestate and wanted to enhance their customers' experience by providing the best service.
{% endcontentfor %}


{% contentfor solution %}
With the current problem Kindred is facing, we have spent hte time to undergo discovery interviews, brainstorming sessions and design solutions that were constnatly re-iterated after user testing.

We finalised our findings by producing a web and mobile-focused system that allowed clients to view available properties and enquire about them immediately.

Clients were able to create their profile, save their favourites and communicate with Kindred employees consistently to accomplish their property goals.

{% contentfor outcome %}
Once we have prototyped, the developers started the frontend development and I customised the styling using <a href="work-harmony">Harmony's</a> Library. I styled using SCSS and with Harmony's pre-defined styles I was able to accomplish these customisations rapidly.

Our client portal for Kindred has been designed for Kindred's clients to view property and enquire about them dynamically.

Our client portal allowed for users to view properties and chat with a Kindred agent to further build their relationship with Kindred and accomplish their property goals.
