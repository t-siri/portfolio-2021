{% contentfor introduction %}
During my employment with <a href="https://workingmouse.com.au/" target="_blank">WorkingMouse</a> I worked for Kindred, a client in real estate.

The client wanted to change the real estate workflow and in order to do so, it required a client portal.

Alongside this client portal, we created the <a href="/work-kindred-admin">Green Zone Portal</a>, which allowed Kindred to communicate with clients promptly.

{% contentfor problem %}
Kindred wanted an innovative way for clients to contact them whenever they would see fit to their own schedule and receive a response right away.

Our client saw a flaw in real estate and wanted to enhance their customers' experience by providing the best service.
{% endcontentfor %}


{% contentfor solution %}
With the current problem Kindred was facing, we had spent the time to undergo discovery interviews, brainstorming sessions and design solutions that were constantly re-iterated after user testing.

We finalised our findings by producing a web and mobile-focused system that allowed clients to view available properties and enquire about them immediately.

Clients were able to create their profile, save their favourites and communicate with Kindred employees consistently to accomplish their property goals.

{% contentfor outcome %}
When we prototyped, the developers started the frontend development and I customised the styling using <a href="work-harmony">Harmony's</a> Library. I styled using SCSS and with Harmony's pre-defined styles I was able to accomplish these customisations rapidly.

Our client portal for Kindred had been designed for Kindred's clients to view property and enquire about them dynamically.

Our client portal allowed users to view properties and chat with a Kindred agent to further build their relationship with Kindred and accomplish their property goals.
