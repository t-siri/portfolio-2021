						<p>I am from Bangkok, Thailand and have been living in Brisbane since 2013. </p>
						<p>I am a UIX Designer with front-end development skills and aim to be a UIX Engineer in the
							future with my skill sets. </p>
						<br>
						<p>My passion for creativity alongside the desire to solve problems has led me to become the
							bridge between design and frontend development. I am more focused on Design today but with my
							agility, I am able to pick up other skill sets when required.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I believe that learning is important and no matter the circumstances, as long as there is
							knowledge gained, nothing is lost.</p>
						<br>
						<p>My goal has been established towards what I do in my career and for the future, by finding
							solutions to problems and help those that helpless with
							technology and innovative solutions and designs.</p>
