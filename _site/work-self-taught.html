<p>Self taught is an online application that aids students learn languages and log their progress in regards to their studies, homework and verbal practice.</p>

<p>If assigned, teachers can view their students’ progress and review/assign their homework. Additionally, students have the capability of reviewing their own assignments by adding self assigned homework, new words to their dictionary and audiobook for further practice.</p>

<p>During my time working with my client in regards to this project, I was focusing on introducing a modern user interface design and mobile user experience design.</p>

        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Given that Self Taught was already built and deployed, my client came to me to re-iterate the application and look into a modern user interface design as he wanted to reach more users.</p>

<p>Further understanding his problem, I did a few investigations on his project and noted down improvements that could be introduced.</p>

<p>I conducted user research with students who study languages and wanted to further advance their skills in their own accord. Additionally, I did market research and discovered what competitors where doing.</p>

<p>I presented my findings to my client and refined the problem to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>More modern user interface</li>
  <li>Simpler navigation system</li>
  <li>Quickly jump to a time gap and view changes</li>
  <li>Mobile responsive application</li>
  <li>Mobile user experience</li>
</ul>

        <p class="h3 border-box-heading">ideate & refine</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>From the refinement of the problem that my client had, it was crucial to identify the user’s journey in order to produce the right navigating system. The client and I workshopped on a few user journeys and were able to identify the main user journey for the students using the application. From there, I spent some time researching for inspiration and patterns in regards to platforms that were doing similar functionalities. I presented my findings to my client and we started to brainstorm a few ideas on what the mobile application could additionally have the web application did not. My client and I discussed on potential features that could be included in the new designs. From there, I spent some time sketching a few ideas of the mobile application as well as a few tweaks I the web application, showed my client and re-iterated on the sketches. Once he had a clear understanding of the sketches, I started inspiration research in regards to user interface designs and noted down on design changes that could be made. From there, I immediately moved onto the Hi-Fi prototype.</p>

        <div class="work-desc">
<p>I identified that the prototype required a more modernised but simple approach to the user interface design. Given that there are two main navigating systems and nested information, the simplicity of the UI is crucial. I started the mobile designs first and re-iterated with my client with the navigating system and the nested pages. From there I conducted user testing and made updates in regards to component placements and sizes. Once user testing resulted into a manner where our users were able to complete assigned tasks on the prototype without hesitation, I immediately moved onto the web application prototype. Given the web application provides more real estate in regards to UI placement, it was less complex as the mobile prototype. I user tested the web application and re-iterated a few components and presented to my client.</p>
