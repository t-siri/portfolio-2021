<p>During my employment with <a href="https://workingmouse.com.au/" target="_blank">WorkingMouse</a> I had the opportunity as a Product Designer to work with Kindred, a client in the real-estate space.</p>

<p>Our client previously scoped with us in regards to the <a href="/work-kindred-admin">Green Zone Portal</a>, and given on how successfully the outcome of the previous scope was, our clients wanted to further proceed on expanding the portal for Admin users.</p>

        <div class="work-desc">
<p>After a successful scope with Kindred’s client portal, our client wanted us to further expand on the platform and look into a more feasible way for Admin users’ workflow to be a part of the platform in order to have a better process in their routine of work.</p>

<p>Given the broadness of the problem, it was important to conduct user interviews. Once gathering feedback from Managers (Admin users), we were able to refine the problem and focus on the core pain point the Mangers were currently undergoing in regards to their workflow.</p>

<p>We presented the findings to Kindred’s CEO and identified that Mangers are not able to keep track on how the company’s daily progress in regards to customer service, sales, and client satisfaction. In addition, it uncertain on how successful the Green Zone Portal was and if the portal was reaching to any customers or having a positive impact. Therefore, it was crucial for Managers to track the company’s progress in general, and in addition, with the right statistics, marketers would be able to provide the right campaigns to the right customers according to their level of interaction on the platform.</p>

        <p class="h3 border-box-heading">ideate & refine</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Upon narrowing down the problem, we started workshopping on potential ideas with the client on what the Admin users might require in order to simplify their workflow in the company. We brainstormed multiple ideas with post-it notes and grouped them together.</p>

<p>After ideating with our clients, we refined the ideas with Admin users and the CEO during the ideation workshop by asking them to vote on which grouping of post-it notes felt the most important to them.</p>

<p>This resulted into the following:</p>

<p class="b ul-heading">Admin Users (CEO, Customer Service Team Manager, Sales Manager)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Statistics on customer service team
    <ul>
      <li>Enquiries (made, unanswered, answered) statistics</li>
      <li>Leads</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Information on customers
    <ul>
      <li>New comers</li>
      <li>Interactions and engagement
        <ul>
          <li>Responsiveness (view vs opened)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sales statistics
    <ul>
      <li>Source of enquiries</li>
      <li>Opportunities</li>
      <li>Leads</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ability to set up client expectations on customer service team’s availability</li>
</ul>

<p class="b ul-heading">Marketers</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to view statistics on admin users in order to provide the right content to customers</li>
  <li>Create, save, update and schedule campaigns</li>
  <li>Create campaign templates</li>

        <p class="h3 border-box-heading">build, test & re-iterate</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Given the refined ideas after the ideation stage, it was somewhat clear on what the user flows were for Admin users and Marketers. I researched for inspiration, common patterns, and what competitors were doing in regards to displaying statistics without overwhelming the user and patterns of campaign creating platforms. With the outcome of my research, I started sketching a few screens and continuously re-iterated them by user testing my sketches and refining the user flow and the components. Continuously iterating, a point was reached where the users were satisfied with the flow of the screen of the sketches, I then started to wireframe the sketches and did a final round of user testing. I made a few minor tweaks to the wireframes regarding on components and placements of them and started on the Hi-Fi prototype.</p>

<p>Given that the Green Zone Portal was already scoped, I was able to expand on the original prototype and design the extended screens for the Admin users. The clickable prototype was then user tested continuously alongside re-iterating the designs.</p>

<p>As the main user for the Admin portal was Kindred’s CEO, we presented the prototype and made a few minor tweaks and went straight to development.</p>
