<p>We have conducted a way to run a scope process that included interviewing users that will be using the application. Alongside that, we researched on solutions for this portal and wireframed multiple solutions, until we came up with a finalised one.</p>

<p>We have concluded that since clients want to communicate with Kindred’s employees and build a relationship, it was required to create an admin portal to allow this flowing communication.</p>

<p>This design solution was created to solve problems for Kindred’s Green Zone customer service team, marketers and for the CEO to view statistics.</p>
