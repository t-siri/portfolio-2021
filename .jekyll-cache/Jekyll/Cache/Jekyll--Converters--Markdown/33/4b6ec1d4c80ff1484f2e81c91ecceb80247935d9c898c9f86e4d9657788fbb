<p>I wrote the website in HTML and styled in SCSS. I made sure that the website was mobile friendly as well because my clientâ€™s sales team often travels around Thailand to sell products.</p>

<p>By using JavaScript, I was able to make the website translate to Thai promptly and immediately - as some customers cannot read English.</p>

<p>Although, today many people may argue that a splash page is an extra and unwanted page. I felt that it was important to show the SVG animations and also the <em>feel</em> of the company with the elegance and animations provided - which, the other pages would cover up given the content.</p>
