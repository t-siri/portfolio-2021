<p>It was very tedious for me to find items that I liked at a cheap price and I would spend a significant amount of time before purchasing a product.</p>

<p>Even when I would window-shop in stores, I wanted to watch an item because I didnâ€™t want to pay the full price for it.</p>

<p>Sometimes finding a good deal or the cheapest item available takes longer than you expect, and when you want to keep watching the item, you end up with multiple tabs opened in your browser.</p>

<p>The problem statement: How can we have a better window shopping experience and purchase an item at the lowest price with minimal research time.</p>
