<p>With time spent on user research and product research, we were able to come up with a few designs for these behaviours and we constantly re-iterated with user testing.</p>

<p>Since the company is develops multiple projects and that Codebots have multiple components, it was required to standardise the components and also style them accordingly.</p>

<p>Once we were satisfied with the designs, I then spent the time to write the HTML standards for these behaviours and worked with the developers to creating them with alongside the bots.</p>

<p>I then styled these behaviours and components in the Harmony library.</p>
