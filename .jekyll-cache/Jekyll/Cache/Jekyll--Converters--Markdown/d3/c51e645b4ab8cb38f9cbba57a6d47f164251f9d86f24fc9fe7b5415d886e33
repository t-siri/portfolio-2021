<p>During my employment with <a href="/workingmouse" target="_blank">WorkingMouse</a> I had the opportunity to work with <a href="/codebotsmarketing">Codebots</a> and developed both <a href="/work-codebots-v1">version 1</a> and version 2 of the marketing website.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to design <a href="/codebotssolaris">Codebots Solaris Design System</a> and develop it. My lead Isaac Joekong alongside my coworker Raouf Al-Araji and I worked on the components design.</p>

<p>The idea behind Solaris is to have a source of truth in Codebots design and content creativity. To make sure that products are harmonised and in sync.</p>
