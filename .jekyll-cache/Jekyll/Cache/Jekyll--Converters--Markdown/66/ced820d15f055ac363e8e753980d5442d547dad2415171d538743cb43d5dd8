<p>Carted is a side project I have found and is a current work in progress.</p>

<p>The idea behind this came from me and how I wanted to simplify my shopping experience in general.</p>

<p>One day, I walked into IKEA and wanted a chair but did not want to pay the price, then I thought to myself: <em>â€˜If only I could scan the barcocde of the item and get a notification when itâ€™s on sale.</em></p>

<p>And that was how the project started</p>
