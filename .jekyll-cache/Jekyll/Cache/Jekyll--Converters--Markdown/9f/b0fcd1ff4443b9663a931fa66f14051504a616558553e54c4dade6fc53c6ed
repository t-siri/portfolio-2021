<p>After some research on how sales are done in Thailand as well as inspiration research, I came up with the design.</p>

<p>I wanted the lines to represent hairs, and during the time I was designing and developing the site, I was experimenting with <strong>SVG animations</strong> and wanted to further explore that.</p>

<p>Although, today many people may argue that a splash page is an extra and unwanted page. I felt that it was important to show the SVG animations and also the <em>feel</em> of the company with the elegance and animations provided - which, the other pages would cover up given the content.</p>
