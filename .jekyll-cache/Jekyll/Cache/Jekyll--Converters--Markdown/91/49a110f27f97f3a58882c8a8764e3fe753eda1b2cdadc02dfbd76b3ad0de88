<p>It was recognised that the website had a lot of content and had to be broken up into a few more sections. There were also some more <em>modern</em> designs that could be introduced such as a carousel component and tabs to view information.</p>

<p>Components were re-iterated and written in a way to allow re-use. I also had the opportunity to update and clean a few sections in order to hand-over to the next developer.</p>
