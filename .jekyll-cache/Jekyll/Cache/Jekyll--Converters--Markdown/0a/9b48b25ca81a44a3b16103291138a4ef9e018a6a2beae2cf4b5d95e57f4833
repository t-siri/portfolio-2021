<p>We have conducted a way to run a scope process that included interviewing users that will be using the application. Alongside that, we researched on solutions for this portal and wire framed multiple solutions, until we came up with a finalised one.</p>

<p>We have concluded that since clients want to communicate with Kindred’s employees and build a relationship, it was required to create an admin portal to allow this flowing communication.</p>

<p>This design solution was created to solve problems for Kindred’s Green Zone customer service team, marketers and for the CEO to view statistics.</p>
