<p>After some research on how sales are done in Thailand as well as inspiration research, I came up with the design.</p>

<p>I wanted the lines to represent hairs, and during the time I was designing and developing the site, I was experimenting with <strong>SVG animations</strong> and wanted to further explore that.</p>

<p>I then produced 4 main pages that my client had requested and started develping them.</p>
