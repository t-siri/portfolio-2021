<p>My client requested to redesign the application that he developed, he wanted it to be mobile responsive and more user-friendly.</p>

<p>He also requested a more modern design and a better user flow in the app.</p>

<p>Since my client wanted to focus on the students in this application, I had decided to redesign the application as a student user and focus on the experience of the application as a student.</p>
