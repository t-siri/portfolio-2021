<p>With the current problem Kindred was facing, we had spent the time to undergo discovery interviews, brainstorming sessions and design solutions that were constantly re-iterated after user testing.</p>

<p>We finalised our findings by producing a web and mobile-focused system that allowed clients to view available properties and enquire about them immediately.</p>

<p>Clients were able to create their profile, save their favourites and communicate with Kindred employees consistently to accomplish their property goals.</p>
