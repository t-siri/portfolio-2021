<p>I have decided to design the mobile experience of the application first and made sure to design the web after.</p>

<p>I interviewed the students and their process into learning a new language and how they would have used the application, I found their pain points and made sure I tend to them.</p>

<p>The application was then redesigned with a new UI and UX.</p>
