<p>Alongside these designs, I standardised them by writing the HTML structure for them and also created an SCSS library named Harmony that styles these components.</p>

<p>These bots and Harmony has two sections to them the Admin section and the Frontend section and I had the challenge to implement a library to style both ends separately but also allows customisation in the frontend.</p>

<p>The bot now produces standardised components and behaviours that are styled accordingly.</p>
