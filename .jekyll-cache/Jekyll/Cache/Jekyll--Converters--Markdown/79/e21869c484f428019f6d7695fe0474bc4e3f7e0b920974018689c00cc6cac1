<p>It was very tedious for me to find items that I liked at a cheap price and I would spend a significant amount of time before purchasing a product.</p>

<p>Even when I would window shop in stores, I wanted to watch an item becuase I didnâ€™t want to pay full price for it.</p>

<p>Sometimes finding a good deal or the cheapest item available takes longer than you expect, and when you want to keep watching the item, you end up with multiple tabs opened in your browser.</p>
