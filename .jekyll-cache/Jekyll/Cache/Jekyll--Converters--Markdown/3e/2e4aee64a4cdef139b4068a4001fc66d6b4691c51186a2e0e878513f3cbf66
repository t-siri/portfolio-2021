<p>I came up with this wishlist idea and have worked on the designs on it as a side project.</p>

<p>I did some research to see how competitors were doing <em>(which the closest one was 9 years ago)</em>. Then did some user research to understand individualsâ€™ painpoints and what would make their life easier if this app were to be used by them.</p>

<p>I then discussed with a group of developers and moved on to branding and design work.</p>

<p>I wanted the colours to be less of a <em>spending</em> money experience but a <em>list</em> of things you want to be notified about.</p>

<p>The branding is also accesisible for the colour blind as well.</p>
