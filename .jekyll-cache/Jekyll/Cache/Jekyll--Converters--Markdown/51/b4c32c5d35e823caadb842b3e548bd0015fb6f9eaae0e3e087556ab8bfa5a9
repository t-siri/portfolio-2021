<p>My client wanted a website to not only represent their company, but displays the products they produce and allow users to understand the companyâ€™s goals.</p>

<p>It was specifically important to show products available as my client could quickly jump onto the website and show their customers products they sell.</p>

<p>It was important that the website was mobile friendly and also translated to Thai promptly as not all Advance Cabelloâ€™s clients read English.</p>
