        <div class="work-desc">
<p>Carted is a side project I have founded and is a current work in progress.</p>

<p>The idea behind this came from me and how I wanted to simplify my shopping experience in general.</p>

<p>One day, I walked into IKEA and wanted a chair but did not want to pay the price, then I thought to myself: <em>‘If only I could scan the barcocde of the item and get a notification when it’s on sale.</em></p>

<p>And that was how the project started</p>

        <p class="h3 border-box-heading">the problem</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>It was very tedious for me to find items that I liked at a cheap price and I would spend a significant amount of time before purchasing a product.</p>

<p>Even when I would window shop in stores, I wanted to watch an item becuase I didn’t want to pay full price for it.</p>

<p>Sometimes finding a good deal or the cheapest item available takes longer than you expect, and when you want to keep watching the item, you end up with multiple tabs opened in your browser.</p>

<p>The problem statement: How can we have a better window shopping experience and purchase an item at the lowest price with minimal research time.</p>

        <p class="h3 border-box-heading">the solution</p>
        <div class="work-desc">
<p>I came up with this wishlist idea and have worked on the designs on it as a side project.</p>

<p>I did some research to see how competitors were doing <em>(which the closest one was 9 years ago)</em>. Then did some user research to understand individuals’ painpoints and what would make their life easier if this app were to be used by them.</p>

<p>I then discussed with a group of developers and moved on to branding and design work.</p>

<p>I wanted the colours to be less of a <em>spending</em> money experience but a <em>list</em> of things you want to be notified about.</p>

<p>The branding is also accesisible for the colour blind as well.</p>

        <div class="work-desc">
<p>This ongoing project’s goal is to help users with their shopping experience and to help them find the best product and price for it as quick as possible.</p>

<p>I have completed the prototype and now have started on front-end development making sure that the components are up to standards and accessible.</p>
